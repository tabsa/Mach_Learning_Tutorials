# Example of Classifier for movie rating
This example follows the tutorial series from the github [repo](https://github.com/dkhundley/movie-ratings-model) from David Hundley [follow the author here](https://dkhundley.medium.com/).

More details about the tutorial series are in this [link](https://medium.com/tag/dkhundley-movie-model/archive) as well.

## Problem statement
The objective is for creating a ML model that provides two scores to each movie rating:
 - Binary 'approve / disapprove' score
 - 0 to 10 float score

 This will make us to create two distinct ML models:
  - Classifier for the binary score
  - Regression-based for the [0-10] score
